### Imports
- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests.
- `base64`: Used for encoding and decoding data in base64 format.
- `streamlit`: Used for creating interactive web apps.

### Variables
- `owner`: Represents the owner of the GitHub repository.
- `repo`: Represents the repository name.
- `list_of_contents`: Dictionary to store file paths and their content.
- `list_all_files`: List to store all file paths fetched.

### Functions
- `_fetch_contents`: Recursively fetches the contents of files in the repository.
- `_fetch_file_content`: Fetches and decodes the content of a specific file in the repository.
- `fetch_files`: Initiates the recursive fetching of files from the repository.
- `display_files`: Displays the fetched files in Streamlit and prints them.

### Function Parameters
- `__init__(self, owner, repo)`: Initializes the `GitHubRepoFetcher` class with owner and repo parameters.

### Classes
- `GitHubRepoFetcher`: Class to fetch GitHub repository contents.

### Classes's Attributes
- `owner`: Owner of the repository.
- `repo`: Name of the repository.
- `list_of_contents`: Stores file paths and their content.
- `list_all_files`: Stores all file paths fetched.

### Classes's Methods
- `_fetch_contents`: Fetches contents of files recursively.
- `_fetch_file_content`: Fetches and decodes content of a specific file.
- `fetch_files`: Initiates fetching of files.
- `display_files`: Displays fetched files.

### IF/Else
- Used to handle responses from the GitHub API.

### While Loop
- Not present in the provided code.

### For Loop
- Used to iterate over fetched files and display them.

### Algorithm Used
- The code recursively fetches the contents of files in a GitHub repository using the GitHub API.

### Data Structures
- `list_of_contents`: Dictionary to store file paths and content.
- `list_all_files`: List to store file paths.

### Suggestions
- Consider handling exceptions more gracefully (e.g., using `try-except` blocks).
- Use logging instead of `print` statements for better code maintenance.
- Avoid printing directly inside functions; return values and handle printing outside functions.
- Utilize Streamlit features more effectively for a better user interface.
- Add more error handling mechanisms for robustness.
