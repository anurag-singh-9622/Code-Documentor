### Imports
- Imported `Github` from the module `github`.
- Imported `os` for handling file path manipulations.

### Variables
- `owner`: Represents the owner of the GitHub repository.
- `repo_name`: Represents the name of the GitHub repository.
- `token`: Represents the token required for GitHub authentication.
- `github`: Represents the `Github` object used for interaction with the GitHub API.
- `dict_file_content`: Dictionary with file paths as keys and content as values.
- `commit_message`: The message to be used when committing changes.
- `extension`: File extension to be appended to file paths.

### Functions
- `__init__`: Constructor method to initialize the `GitHubRepoPusher` class.
- `push_files`: Method to push files to a GitHub repository from a dictionary.

### Function parameters
- `owner`, `repo_name`, `token`: Parameters for initializing the class in the constructor.
- `dict_file_content`, `commit_message`, `extension`: Parameters for pushing files in the `push_files` method.

### Classes
- `GitHubRepoPusher`: Represents a class to push files to a GitHub repository.

### Classes's Attributes
- `owner`: Owner of the GitHub repository.
- `repo_name`: Name of the GitHub repository.
- `token`: Authentication token.
- `github`: Instance of `Github` for interaction with GitHub.

### Classes's Methods
- `__init__`: Constructor to initialize class attributes.
- `push_files`: Method to push files to GitHub.

### IF/Else
- Used to handle the case where the file already exists or needs to be created.

### While loop
- Not used in the provided code.

### For loop
- Used to iterate over the dictionary containing file paths and content.

### Algorithm Used
- Iterate over each file in the dictionary.
- Check if the file exists in the repository.
- If the file exists, update it; otherwise, create a new file.

### Data structures
- Dictionary (`dict_file_content`) to store file paths and content.
- Strings for file paths, content, and commit messages.

### Suggestions
- It's good practice to handle exceptions more specifically rather than catching all exceptions. This ensures better error handling.
- Add more descriptive docstrings to explain the purpose of each method and class.
- Consider error handling for cases like invalid GitHub credentials or network issues.
- Include input validation to ensure the parameters passed are correct types or values.
